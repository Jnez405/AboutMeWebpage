                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm Jesus Ordunez, born and raised in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
                    I studied to become a computer support technician at OCCC. 
                    I used to work as a Printer Technician, which helped me gain technical skills. 
                    However, my interest in technology led me to learn coding. 
                    Now, I'm part of the Code 201 program, aiming to excel in software development. 
                    My life goal is to travel the world and explore what is out there.
